C Program to Swap Two Numbers
This example contains two different techniques to swap numbers in C programming. The first program uses temporary variable to swap numbers, whereas the second program doesn't use temporary variables.

Swaping Number 
To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of following C programming topics:

C Data Types
C Programming Operators
C Input Output (I/O)
Example 1: Program to Swap Numbers Using Temporary Variable
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
      double firstNumber, secondNumber, temporaryVariable;
      printf("Enter first number: ");
      scanf("%lf", &firstNumber);
      printf("Enter second number: ");
      scanf("%lf",&secondNumber);
      // Value of firstNumber is assigned to temporaryVariable
      temporaryVariable = firstNumber;
      // Value of secondNumber is assigned to firstNumber
      firstNumber = secondNumber;
      // Value of temporaryVariable (which contains the initial value of firstNumber) is assigned to secondNumber
      secondNumber = temporaryVariable;
      printf("\nAfter swapping, firstNumber = %.2lf\n", firstNumber);
      printf("After swapping, secondNumber = %.2lf", secondNumber);
      return 0;
}
